# Websites & Web Apps
## Adding Websites
1. Go into Edit Mode, either through the settings or by pressing the B button on the controller
2. On the bottom right, select `Add Website`
3. You can select from one of the presets, or type in your any website URL
4. Click the add button to add the website to the currently selected group

Once added, you can change the icon, label, and group of websites like any other app

## Using Websites
- Once a website is added, it will show up on the Launcher like an app
- You will be prompted the first time any website requests to use the mic, its highly recommended to accept this!
  - Once permission is granted, you'll never be asked again
  - If you fail to grant the permission, you must grant LightningLauncher permission to use the microphone through the Android Settings app
  - You can still universally mute your mic through the Quest's quick panel
- Clicking on it will open the website in an internal brower, which works as you'd expect
- When you close the browser or the entire window, the website *will not stop*
  - It will continue playing and/or recording audio in the background
  - If you reopen a website running in the background, it will resume and not reload
  - Websites the are currently running will display a small indicator on their icons, click this indicator to kill them
  - Most media will get paused when the headset goes to sleep or is taken off your head, and must be resumed manually
- If you navigate to a different url than you started on, you'll see a \[+\] icon by the current URL. Click it to add the current page to the Launcher

## Multitasking
- You can open the launcher however you'd like during gameplay. Note that performance of 2D apps will be poor while a demanding game is running.
- By long-pressing an app or website, you can set it to open in its own window, independent of the launcher. This allows for painless multitasking similar to the native launcher, but *some apps may not always launch if set to open in their own windows*
- Each shortcut option opens in its own window. If you move the windows so they don't overlap, you can have up to three instances of Lightning Launcher open at once
- You can only open one instance of each added website, but you can open multiple different websites at once

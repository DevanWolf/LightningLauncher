# Shortcut Options (Quest)

**As of Quest v63, you may simply launch Lightning Launcher once, then drag its icon to the Dock.**

## Horizon Feed Shortcut
1. Install the Explore Shortcut from `Settings->Shortcut Settings`
2. (Recommended) Disable the Explore app using the button in `Settings->Shortcut Settings` This will prevent it from opening on startup or when you click its icon
3. Activate the service, following the simple instructions that pop up
4. Close the LightningLauncher window

Now LightningLauncher will open whenever you hover over or click on the Horizon Feed icon on the dock.

**Note:** You will no longer be able to use the Horizon Feed app while it is disabled

## Library Shortcut
1. Install the Library Shortcut from `Settings->Shortcut Settings`
2. Activate the service, following the simple instructions that pop up
3. Close the LightningLauncher window

Now LightningLauncher will open whenever you hover over the Library *(default launcher)* icon on the dock.

**Note:** It will be difficult to open the normal Library while the shortcut is enabled

## People Shortcut
1. Install the People Shortcut from `Settings->Shortcut Settings`
2. Activate the service, following the simple instructions that pop up
3. Close the LightningLauncher window

Now LightningLauncher will open whenever you hover over the People icon on the dock.


## Multitasking
- Each shortcut opens its own window, meaning you can multitask by moving one window to the side before opening another
- All three shortcuts allow you to open LightningLauncher in all three spaces for windows on the Quest!
- You may add the shortcuts to the Dock, and use them simply as seperate windows; For this, you do not need to actually activate each shortcut service.

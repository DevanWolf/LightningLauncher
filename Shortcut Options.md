# Shortcut Options
## Messenger Icon
1. If Facebook Messenger is installed, uninstall it
2. Install the Messenger Shortcut from `Settings->Shortcut Settings` 
3. Find "Messenger" on the apps screen of the default launcher. Hover over it, select the three dots, then "Pin to Universal Menu"
  
Now you can use the Messenger icon on the dock to open LightningLauncher from anywhere!

_With this option only, you can drag the messenger icon to the left or right multitasking spaces in the quest to open Lightning Launcher there_

**Note:** You will periodically see popups informing you that your messenger app is modified. If you select restore, you will need to repeat Steps 2&3.

## Explore Shortcut
1. Install the Explore Shortcut from `Settings->Shortcut Settings`
2. (Recommended) Disable the Explore app using the button in `Settings->Shortcut Settings` This will prevent it from opening on startup or when you click its icon
3. Activate the service, following the simple instructions that pop up
4. Close the LightningLauncher window

Now LightningLauncher will open whenever you hover over or click on the Explore icon on the dock.

**Note:** You will no longer be able to use the Explore app

## App Library Shortcut
1. Install the Library Shortcut from `Settings->Shortcut Settings`
2. Activate the service, following the simple instructions that pop up
3. Close the LightningLauncher window

Now LightningLauncher will open whenever you hover over the App Library *(default launcher)* icon on the dock.

**Note:** You will no longer be able to use the Explore app

## Multitasking
- Each shortcut opens its own window, meaning you can multitask by moving one window to the side before opening another *(Quest Only)*
- All three shortcuts allow you to open LightningLauncher in all three spaces for windows on the Quest!
